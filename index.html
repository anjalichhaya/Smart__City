        <h1 style="font-family:Baskerville;"><u>What is Smart City?</u></h1>
        <p>A smart city is a technologically modern urban area that uses different types of electronic methods and sensors to collect specific data. Information gained from that data is used to manage assets, resources and services efficiently, in return, that data is used to improve operations across the city.This includes data collected from citizens, devices, buildings and assets that is processed and analyzed to monitor and manage traffic and transportation systems,power plants, utilities, urban forestry, water supply networks, waste, criminal investigations, information systems, schools, libraries, hospitals, and other community services.Smart cities are defined as smart both in the ways in which their governments harness technology as well as in how they monitor, analyze, plan, and govern the city. In smart cities, the sharing of data is not limited to the city itself but also includes businesses, citizens and other third parties that can benefit from various uses of that data. Sharing data from different systems and sectors creates opportunities for increased understanding and economic benefits.</p>

<section>
<h1 style="font-family:Baskerville";><u>Data and interpretation of smart city</u></h1>


<p>Smart cities rely heavily on data-driven decision- making to improve the services they offer for citizens and businesses, the well-being of citizens, sustainability, and economic development.</p>
<p>• Data analytics can help make informed decisions, leading to more efficient and effective city operations.</p>

<p>• Incorporating data-driven decision-making and analytics into smart city curriculums can help identify and understand urban problems and improve decision-making.</p>

<p>• Sharing data internally and externally is key to building effective smart cities. Collecting and sharing data in formats that everyone can understand and benefit from drives data democratization and supports a more data- driven, open society.</p>
<p>• Data analysis helps urban planners and policymakers understand the evolving needs of the city and its residents. By examining demographic trends, economic indicators, and social patterns, cities can develop more effective urban development plans that address housing, transportation, and environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>•Advanced analytics and data processing techniques are used to interpret the collected data. This includes the use of machine learning algorithms, data mining, and statistical analysis to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies within the data sets. This analysis helps in understanding the current state of the city, predicting future trends, and making informed decisions.</p>

<h3>Singapore</h3>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Singapore_Skyline_at_Bluehour.jpg/640px-Singapore_Skyline_at_Bluehour.jpg" alt="image1" width="660" height="345">

<p>Numerous factors contribute to the reputation of Singapore as the metropolis of the future. The city's first industry-led smart city lab has been operating there since 2020. In order to further develop smart city technologies, more than 30 organisations, including Amazon Web Services, Cisco Systems, and Schneider Electric, are working together in the Smart Urban Co- Innovation Lab. Consider the digitisation of the hospital system, which enables TeleHealth video consultations and TeleRehab, among other things.

Singapore has implemented various smart city projects, including its deployment of an auton omous fleet to help the elderly and those with restricted mobility get around. Elderly people can benefit from the use of robots and Al- powered chatbots since they can deliver helpful information and minimise their loneliness.</p>
<h3>Hamburg</h3>
<img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/22/14/hamburg-main.jpg?" alt="image2"  width="660" height="345">
<p>Hamburg, the 2011 European Green Capital, has a long-term plan for environmental sustainability. The city's plan calls for the renovation of ageing infrastructure as well as the creation of entirely new neighbourhoods and environmentally friendly structures. Hamburg has already committed €10 billion ($10.84 billion) to green building construction (the public sector has spent $3.25 billion as a comparable benchmark).

Smart controls and low-energy heating are standard in all new construction in Hamburg, and smart technology is being retrofitted into older structures and neighbourhoods. Technology is also being used for digitising people's movement, health, and education.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong</h3>
<img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/629604122/photo/cityscape-hong-kong-and-junkboat-at-twilight.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=iQGOvCiYdXQW-k6_uUJfvYXpJiSmQj-WCOXXOpXy1iE=" alt="image3" width="660" height="345">
<p>In order to develop a world-renowned smart city with a booming economy and good living standards, Hong Kong plans to embrace innovation and technology. Through Smart Environment dashboards, the public can view data collected by sensors throughout the city.

In 2015, when buildings accounted for 90% of Hong Kong's electricity usage, the city's primary initiatives began. In the past year, Hong Kong has reduced its government building electricity consumption by 7.8%, reduced its carbon footprint by 35%, and recovered 1.64 million tonnes of municipal solid waste using smart building technologies, effective trash management, pollution monitoring sensors, and public education campaigns.</p>
<h3>London</h3>
<img src="https://www.goldentours.com/travelblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/shutterstock_555823393-973x649.jpg" alt="image4" width="660" height="345">
<p>CleanTech, GovTech, Digital Health, EdTech, and mobility-related technologies all have a strong presence in London. The municipal government's goal is to create the world's smartest city, and it already has one of the most technologically advanced public transportation systems.

With more than 750 enterprises utilising the city's data - more than Paris and Berlin combined - London is also Europe's artificial intelligence hub and home to the world's largest network of air quality sensors. Plus, there are more than 3,000 parks and green spaces across the country, making it the world's 10th most sustainable city.</p>
